Espresso Notes:
 * Insulating boiler increases heat capacity. But steaming becomes more difficult.
   * May need second boiler, or bleed water through to lower the temp (use an LED to signal bleeding the water through).
 * Combine two temp sensor inputs into a control system package. The outside temp sensor has a delay, so incorperate that into control system.
 * Pressure gauge or sensor to help users.
 * Saftey- limit how long heater is on at a time. Handling fault isrs, improve watchdog, etc.
 * Internal temp sensor is off, so relook up specs on it.
